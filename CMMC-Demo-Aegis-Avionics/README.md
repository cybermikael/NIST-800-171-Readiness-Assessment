## Project Name: CMMC / NIST 800-171 Readiness Assessment
### Prepared by Nehwe Technologies
### This repository demonstrates a CMMC / NIST SP 800-171 readiness assessment framework using a fictional organization to illustrate how a professional compliance engagement is scoped, executed, and delivered.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Showcase a structured, repeatable readiness assessment methodology
- Demonstrate the quality of deliverables provided to small and mid-sized federal contractors
- Provide example artifacts used during real-world compliance preparation efforts

#### This repository does not represent a certification, audit, or attestation of compliance.

### What This Repository Represents
This project simulates a realistic CMMC Readiness engagement performed by a cybersecurity compliance consultant for a small Department of Defense subcontractor.

It include:
- Engagement scoping and assumptions
- CUI boundary definition and flow description
- Evidence request planning and interview methodology
- NIST SP 800-171 gap assessment
- Risk register and POA&M development
- An SSP-Lite suitable for readiness and planning purposes
- An executive-level summary writter for leadership audiences

All content is fictional, sanitized, and for demonstration purposes only.

### Engagement Scope
Frameworks Referenced
- NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2
- CMMC (alignment and readiness only)
Assessment Type
- Readiness / GAP assessment
- No certification, audit, or formal attestation performed
Simulated Environment

### Methodology Summary
The readiness assessment workflow demonstrated in this repository follows a structured approach:
1. Engagement Scoping
- Define assessment boundaries
- Establish CUI scope and assumptions
2. Evidence Planning
- Develop targeted evidence requests
- Identify interview roles
3. Control Assessment
- Evaluate applicable NIST SP 800-171 controls
- Rate implementation status based on evidence
4. Risk & Remediation Planning
- Identify root-cause weaknesses
- Develop a practical POA&M
5. Executive Communication
- Summarize risk posture and remediation priorities
- Provide leadership-focused guidance

This approach emphasizes clarity, defensibility, and practicality over checkbox compliance.

### What This Repository Is Not
- A CMMC certification
- A formal audit or assessment
- Evidence of compliance for any real organization
- A substitute for a Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO)

### Intended Audience
This repository may be useful for:
- Small and mid-sized federal contractors preparing for CMMC
- Compliance and cybersecurity professionals evaluation readiness approaches
- Leadership seeking to understand what a readiness assessment delivers
- Organizations exploring how to structure compliance documentation
