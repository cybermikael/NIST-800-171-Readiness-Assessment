3.1.2 | Limit system access to authorized transactions and functions | Yes | Partially Implemented | Entra ID role assignments, SharePoint permission samples | Role-based access is partially enforced through Entra ID and SharePoint permissions; however, permissions are not consistently reviewed and some users have broader access than required for their role. | Excessive privileges increase the risk of accidental or malicious misuse of CUI.

3.1.3 | Control the flow of CUI within systems | Yes | Partially Implemented | SharePoint site structure review, OneDrive sync configuration | CUI is primarily stored within SharePoint Online; however, controls governing internal sharing and OneDrive synchronization to endpoints are not fully documented or restricted based on data sensitivity. | CUI may be copied or accessed beyond intended locations, increasing exposure risk.

3.1.4 | Separate duties of individuals to reduce risk | Yes | Not Implemented | Interviews with IT coordinator and Ops Manager | No formal separation of duties is defined for administrative, security, and operational roles; administrative access is concentrated among a small number of individuals without documented role separation. | Concentration of privileges increases risk of errors or abuse without detection.

3.1.5 | Employ the principle of least privilege | Yes | Partially Implemented | Entra ID role review, endpoint local admin group samples | Least privilege is partially implemented through standard user accounts; however, local administrator rights are granted to some engineering users without documented justification or periodic review. | Elevated privileges increase the likelihood of malware execution or unauthorized system changes.

3.1.6 | Use non-privileged accounts for non-administrative functions | Yes | Partially Implemented | User account role review, interview notes | Users generally operate under non-privileged accounts for daily activities; however, some administrative-capable accounts are used for routine tasks due to convenience. | Increases risk of privilege misuse or compromise.

3.1.8 | Limit unsuccessful logon attempts | Yes | Implemented | Entra ID security defaults, MFA enforcement | Account lockout and authentication protections are enforced through Entra ID security defaults and MFA configurations. | Low residual risk related to brute-force authentication attempts.

3.1.9 | Provide privacy and security notices upon access | Yes | Not Implemented | Endpoint login screen review, policy documentation | No system use or security warning banners are displayed during user login to endpoints or cloud services. | Lack of user notification weakens legal and policy enforcement posture.

3.1.10 | Use session lock after inactivity | Yes | Partially Implemented | Intune device compliance policy samples | Session lock settings are configured on some managed endpoints; however, policies are not consistently enforced across all devices. | Unlocked systems may be accessed by unauthorized individuals.

3.1.11 | Terminate sessions after defined conditions | Yes | Partially Implemented | Conditional Access policy overview | Session termination is enforced through cloud session controls; however, timeout values are not formally documented or reviewed. | Extended sessions increase exposure window if accounts are compromised.

3.1.12 | Monitor and control remote access sessions | Yes | Partially Implemented | VPN configuration review, Conditional Access policies | Remote access is controlled via VPN and Conditional Access; however, monitoring and logging of remote sessions are limited and not routinely reviewed. | Unauthorized or anomalous remote access activity may go undetected.

3.1.13 | Employ cryptographic mechanisms to protect remote access sessions | Yes | Implemented | VPN encryption settings, HTTPS/TLS configuration | Remote access sessions are protected using encrypted VPN tunnels and TLS-protected cloud services. | Low residual risk related to interception of remote access traffic.

3.1.14 | Route remote access via managed access control points | Yes | Implemented | Network firewall configuration, VPN architecture overview | Remote access to the CUI environment is routed through managed VPN and firewall infrastructure. | Low risk provided configurations remain maintained.

3.1.15 | Authorize remote execution of privileged commands | Yes | Not Implemented | Interview notes, administrative access review | No formal authorization or documentation exists governing remote execution of privileged commands. | Elevated risk of unauthorized or undocumented administrative actions.

3.1.16 | Authorize wireless access prior to connection | Yes | Partially Implemented | Wi-Fi configuration review, network interview | Corporate wireless access requires authentication; however, device authorization and network segmentation controls are not fully documented. | Unauthorized devices may gain access to internal networks.

3.1.17 | Protect wireless access using authentication and encryption | Yes | Implemented | Wireless security configuration | Wireless networks employ encrypted protocols and authentication mechanisms. | Low residual risk if configurations remain enforced.

3.1.18 | Control connection of mobile devices | Yes | Partially Implemented | Mobile device access review, policy documentation | Mobile access to M365 is permitted; however, mobile device management and enforcement of security controls are limited. | CUI may be accessed on devices lacking sufficient security controls.

3.1.19 | Encrypt CUI on mobile devices and mobile computing platforms | Yes | Partially Implemented | Device encryption samples, policy review | Device encryption is enabled on most company-managed laptops; however, enforcement and verification are inconsistent, particularly for mobile devices. | Risk of CUI exposure if devices are lost or stolen.
